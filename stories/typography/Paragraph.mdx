    Headings in typography are essential elements used to establish a clear hierarchy within content. They guide the reader through the structure of the content, making it easier to understand and navigate. Headings range from large, impactful titles to smaller, more detailed subheadings, each serving a distinct role in emphasizing the importance of the text.
