# Loader
 
Indicate the loading state of a component or page with spinners, built entirely with HTML, CSS, and no JavaScript.

## About
Bootstrap “spinners” can be used to show the loading state in your projects. They’re built only with HTML and CSS, meaning you don’t need any JavaScript to create them. You will, however, need some custom JavaScript to toggle their visibility. Their appearance, alignment, and sizing can be easily customized with our amazing utility classes.
